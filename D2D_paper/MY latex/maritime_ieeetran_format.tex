\begin{abstract}

The maritime ship-to-shore communication system has to cover a vast area with limited base stations (BSs) due to the restriction of geographically available BS sites. Therefore, its energy consumption is usually much larger than terrestrial cellular networks. In order to reduce the energy consumption, we optimize user scheduling for a typical maritime ship-to-ship/shore on-shore data distribution system, where ship-to-ship communication allows ships to act like relays and enables direct communication between neighboring vessels, so as to reduce the energy consumption. 
In general, the channel state information (CSI) is crucial for user scheduling. However, it is difficult to acquire perfect CSI in practical applications due to the time-varying channel fading. Different from traditional studies, we use only the large-scale CSI, which varies gradually and can be obtained through the positional information of each vessel based on its specific shipping lane and timetable. 
We formulate a user scheduling optimization problem whose objective is to minimize the total energy consumption while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS). The problem is uncovered to be NP-hard. To solve it, we develop a progressive approach for the original-problem and propose 3 efficient greedy algorithms for the progressive approximation. The algorithms we proposed only require polynomial computational complexity. Simulation results reveal that the user scheduling scheme we provided significantly reduces the energy consumption by up to 81\% over the existing ones in certain cases.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:1}
In recent years, the demand for reliable and high-speed ship-to-shore maritime communication services increases sharply on account of the rapid development of marine activities such as marine tourism, offshore aquaculture, and oceanic mineral exploration. Several maritime communication network (MCN) projects have been developed, e.g., the BLUECOM+ project, the MarCom project, and the TRITON project \cite{p321}--\cite{p32}, in order to meet the increasing demand. 
Unlike terrestrial cellular networks, a maritime ship-to-shore communication system has quite limited geographically available base station (BS) sites. The maritime communication system usually adopts high-powered BSs so as to cover a vast area with limited BSs. This high-powered BS strategy increases the operational costs of mobile network operators and poses a global threat to the environment \cite{p33}.

Accordingly, reducing energy consumption becomes a critical issue for maritime communications. User scheduling, as an important perspective for saving energy, has attracted increasingly worldwide attention. 
In this paper, we introduce the idea of ship-to-ship communications, which %, mimicking terrestrial device-to-device (D2D) communications \cite{p3331}-\cite{p3333}, 
may reduce the total energy consumption by exploiting direct communications between neighboring users. With proximate communication opportunities, ship-to-ship communication may increase spectral efficiency, improve BS coverage, as well as reduce energy consumption, while ensuring the quality of service (QoS). Unfortunately, the introduction of ship-to-ship communications greatly increases the difficulties for user scheduling. 
%Therefore, advanced wireless transmission and radio resource management techniques for maritime ship-to-ship/shore communication systems are in urgent need to solve the power reduction problem.

\subsection{Related work}

%terrestrial
So far, the majority of energy-efficient user scheduling techniques focused on terrestrial cellular networks, and CSI is a crucial factor therein.  
%such as the proportional fairness based schemes in \cite{p61}--\cite{p63}, the signal-to-leakage-interference-plus-noise ratio-based methods in \cite{p64}--\cite{p66}, the coordinated scheduling with cyclic beamforming in \cite{p67}\cite{p68}, and the iterative algorithms in \cite{p69}\cite{p70}. 
Based on the utilization degree of CSI, terrestrial user scheduling schemes can be classified into three categories. The first one required no CSI, such as the simple but efficient round-robin scheme for fair queuing \cite{p51}. The second one exploited statistical and outdated CSI, as studied in \cite{p52} and \cite{p53}. The third one assumed full CSI, and utilized the instantaneous CSI for user scheduling in a minuscule time scale, i.e., in each coherence time \cite{p3}-\cite{p7}. 
In \cite{p3}, the authors proposed a joint antenna-subcarrier-power allocation scheme for distributed antenna systems with limited backhaul capacity to maximize the energy efficiency for min-rate guaranteed services. In \cite{p6}, a matching algorithm of joint sub-channel assignment and power allocation was developed for NOMA networks to optimize both total sum-rate and user fairness. A joint power allocation and user scheduling algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP) was proposed for multi-user MIMO systems to minimize the total energy consumption under hard delay constraints in \cite{p4}. In \cite{p5}, a cross-layer cooperative user scheduling and power allocation scheme was developed for hybrid-delay services, and the fundamental tradeoff between delay and energy consumption was illustrated. Lately, a user scheduling and pilot assignment scheme for massive MIMO systems was proposed in \cite{p7} to serve the maximum number of users with guaranteed QoS.

%maritime
As for maritime user scheduling, limited works have concentrated on energy efficiency. Both \cite{p300} and \cite{p301} focused on monitoring videos uploading via maritime communication networks. They both focus on user scheduling of ship-to-shore communication with the store-carry-and-forward mechanism.
%Towards video packets store-carry-and-forward scheduling in maritime wideband communication
%Efficient Scheduling for Video Transmissions in Maritime Wireless Communication Networks
In \cite{p302}, the authors studied the performance of a multipath TCP controller and demonstrated how path diversity can be implicitly utilized to spread flows across available paths. 
%A performance analysis study of multipath routing in a hybrid network with mobile users
In \cite{p303}, a scheduling model was developed to provide the communication path of the fewest routing times to the moving ships that are far apart, which has reduced the space link resources consumption. 
%Research on optimum cooperative relay model for moving targets based on ant colony algorithm
In \cite{p400}, an efficient user scheduling algorithm aiming to optimize the pilot power under the average power constraint was proposed. 
In \cite{p402}, scheduling transmission of MAC control messages and data packets within three-hop neighborhood is investigated for the purpose of minimizing interference. 

All of the mentioned energy-efficient user scheduling heavily depend on CSI. However, it is rather costly to acquire perfect CSI, due to the excessive system overhead including pilot overhead and feedback overhead \cite{p403}-\cite{p405}. 
%when mmwave communications meet network densification
With respect to maritime ship-to-ship/shore communication, the conflict between the limitation in power and spectrum (limited BSs covering the vast area) and heavy overhead for full CSI becomes more intense, on account of the dynamic of the maritime channel.

\subsection{Contributions}

%问题-》帽子
Given the difficulties in obtaining perfect CSI in ship-to-ship/shore maritime communication systems, current studies on user scheduling for terrestrial scenarios require systematic redesign for the following reasons. 

%1.海域模型，大尺度主导
\textbf{1.} As there are fewer scatterers on the sea than that in the terrestrial scenario, the large-scale channel fading becomes the dominant factor for the maritime channel \cite{p403}. Hence, we can use the position information of vessels to exploit large-scale CSI instead of the complete instantaneous CSI. Through large-scale CSI, we avoid the heavy overhead for full CSI; 
%when mmwave communications meet network densification

%2.航线·位置信息
\textbf{2.} Different from the random trails of human beings in terrestrial scenarios where the previous studies focused on, most vessels have specific fixed shipping-lanes and timetables that can be acquired beforehand, thus their positional information can be easily predicted. From the positional information, we can obtain large-scale CSI  for the whole service duration. With long-term large-scale CSI, we can have extensive gain by considering the whole service process instead of the short timescale in terrestrial scenarios. 

For the purpose of better having better system energy efficiency, we introduce the idea of ship-to-ship communications, where vessels act like relays in the data distribution network. In previous works, like \cite{p321}, \cite{p32}, and \cite{p410}, ship-to-ship communications have been considered in the maritime network system. Nevertheless, to the best of authors' knowledge, the area still remains undiscovered where we consider ship relay transmission to reduce energy consumption. Maritime ship relay transmission may bring forward great improvements energy-wise for the following reasons.

\textbf{1.} Direct relay transmission between neighboring ships can significantly reduce the system transmission energy. 

\textbf{2.} Since maritime users focus more on the data volume and validity rather than transmission delay, the BS can transmit data to a ship relay, which then store-carry-and-forward the data to the target user. 

Thus, the ship relay transmission enabled by ship-to-ship communication is promising in reducing system energy consumption. 
Unfortunately, ship-to-ship relay transmission introduces more transmitters (BS/relays), which bring more difficulties in user scheduling. 



%In this paper, we further explore a 3-dimensional optimization subspace, including one transmitter (BS/relay) dimension, benefiting from IoV; one receiver dimension; and one time dimension, as we make channel estimation by utilizing the service process information, which has not been considered in the previous studies. Through enlarging the optimization subspace, we reduce the energy consumption for maritime communications with IoV. 
%We introduced IoV since IoV allows direct transmission between neighboring vessels and reduce system energy consumption. Unfortunately, IoV links bring forward great difficulties in user scheduling since receivers have to choose transmitters between BS and other vessels (relays) for best efficiency. 
%Apart from IoV user scheduling, the major challenge for our proposed scheme lies in the calculation of long-term large-scale CSI, as well as obtaining the long-term user requirements. We overcome these difficulties by fully utilizing the following unique features of maritime communications: 
%1.业务需求区别：延时vs量

%\textbf{1.} We particularly focus on the delay-tolerant information distribution service, which is initiated and terminated when a marine user sails into and out of the BS's coverage, respectively, so that we can obtain long-term user requirements. 

%2.海域实时CSI难以获取

%\textbf{2.} As there are fewer scatterers on the sea than that in the terrestrial scenario, we use the position information of vessels to exploit long-term large-scale CSI instead of the complete instantaneous CSI, as the research in \cite{p120} suggests that large-scale channel fading is a good estimate for the complete CSI; 
%3.航线·位置信息

%\textbf{3.} Besides, the users' positions can be predicted based on their specific shipping-lanes and timetables. 
%With delay-tolerant service assumption and large-scale CSI, we address the long-term user requirement problem and the CSI obtaining problem based on the characteristic of maritime communication system. 

%On that basis, we enlarge the optimization subspace by introducing the time dimension. Together with the transmitter dimension introduced by IoV since IoV's superiority in energy consumption, spectral efficiency and BS coverage, our maritime user scheduling scheme explore the 3-dimensional optimization subspace for energy consumption improvement rather than the 1-dimensional (receiver dimension only) optimization subspace in traditional ship-to-shore method. 


% proposed method

In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem for user scheduling in maritime ship-to-ship/shore communication systems, aiming to minimize the energy consumption. % while providing users with delay-tolerant data distribution services. 
The problem is discovered to be NP-hard. % (see Appendix A)
To overcome the difficulties of solving the NP-hard problem, we progressively approach the original-problem. We further propose three efficient algorithms for our progressive approach by taking advantages of large-scale CSI. The progressive algorithms we proposed all have polynomial time complexity.

\subsection{System Parameters}

As shown in Figure 1, the following sections focus on the downlink transmission of a single-BS maritime ship-to-ship/shore communication system. In the system, there are one on-shore BS
% equipped with $L$ antennas 
and  $J$ single-antenna users (ships) in the sea. We assume that there are $N$ subcarriers, and the subcarrier bandwidth is ${B_s}$. In this paper, we only consider two-hop half-duplex `ship-to-ship/shore communications' for simplicity. 

In the studied system, ship-to-ship transmissions use the same licensed band of ship-to-shore transmissions (i.e. one of the $N$ subcarriers), and the same air interface of the ship-to-shore transmissions. 
% As a result, IoV links consumes part of the resources allocated to the BS links.
%, i.e., D2D communications also use the $N$ subcarriers whose bandwidths are ${B_s}$. 
At any given time, each ship-to-ship or ship-to-shore links will use distinct subcarrier. Here in this paper by `link' we mean the transmission from BS/relay to a user during a certain time period. 
Given that we only consider half-duplex transmission, the $J$ single-antenna users can either receive data from one transmitter (BS/relay) or send data to another user (act as a relay) at any given time. 

Without loss of generality, we assume the on-shore BS coverage shape to be a semicircle. 
% with radius $R$. 
Each user sails into and out of the semicircle according to its shipping lane and timetable. 
For each user, delay-torrent service is assumed, and the total amount of the data required by the ${j^{th}}$ user is denoted by $C_j^{QoS}$. Together with long-term large-scale CSI, the delay-tolerant assumption in QoS can bring forward great potential in long-term user scheduling. 
In order to simplify the problem, we only consider ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore transmissions of the ships in the semicircle. We also assume all the users request different data and the system has no ship-to-ship link data reuse.

\subsection{Channel Model \& Large-Scale CSI}

We further assume a modified 2-ray propagation model, since the sea surface is relatively flat \cite{p0}--\cite{p2}. For a given subcarrier, we denote the composite channel gain from the BS/relay $i$ to the user $j$ at time $\tau $ by $\sqrt {{\beta _{i,j,\tau }}} {h_{i,j,\tau }}$. The small-scale fading vectors ${h_{i,j,\tau }}$ follows a complex Gaussian distribution with standard deviation ${\sigma _s} = 1$, i.e., ${h_{i,j,\tau }} \sim \mathcal{CN}(0, \mathbf{I})$. The large-scale fading coefficient ${\beta _{i,j,\tau }}$ is expressed as
\begin{align}
{\beta _{i,j,\tau }} = {\left( {\frac{\lambda }{{4\pi {d_{i,j,\tau }}}}} \right)^2}{\left[ {2\sin \left( {\frac{{2\pi {h_t}{h_r}}}{{\lambda {d_{i,j,\tau }}}}} \right)} \right]^2} ,
\end{align}
where $\lambda $ is the carrier wavelength, ${d_{i,j,\tau }}$ is the distance between the BS/relay $i$ and the user $j$ at time $\tau $. The antenna height of the transmitter and the receiver are represented by $h_t$ and $h_r$ respectively. $P_i = \left\{ {P_0,\left\{ {P_j} \right\}} \right\}$ represents the maximum transmission power of BS or relays (ships). 

To fully utilize the slowly-varying characteristic of the large-scale channel fading, we divide the total service time into $T$ time slots, each lasts $\Delta \tau$. The value $\Delta \tau$ is carefully chosen so that $\beta _{i,j,\tau }$ remains constant in each time slot $t$ (ship $j$ holds still during time slot $t$). Thus, we make it possible to acquire $\beta _{i,j,t} = \mathbb{E} \left [ {\beta _{i,j,\tau }} \right ]$ for $\forall t \in \left\{ {1,...,T} \right\}$ from positional information based on shipping-lanes and timetable. 
In this paper we replace the perfect CSI with long-term large-scale CSI as shown in (2a)-(2d). We justify our replacement by simulations in Section IV. Denote ${\gamma _{i,j,\tau }} = {\raise0.7ex\hbox{${{P_{i} }{\beta _{i,j,\tau }}}$} \!\mathord{\left/
 {\vphantom {{{P_{i} }{\beta _{i,j,\tau }}} {{\sigma ^2}}}}\right.\kern-\nulldelimiterspace}
\!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${{\sigma ^2}}$}}$ for simplicity, the channel capacity or transmission speed in this paper can therefore be simplified as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
{r_{i,j,t}} & = {\mathbb{E}}\left [ {{B_s}{{\log }_2}\left( {1 + \frac{{{P_{i} }{\beta _{i,j,\tau }}{{\left| {{h_{i,j,\tau }}} \right|}^2}}}{{{\sigma ^2}}}} \right)} \right ] ,\\
& = {\mathbb{E}}\left [  {B_s}{\log }_2 \left( {1 + {\gamma _{i,j,\tau }}{{\left| {{h_{i,j,\tau }}} \right|}^2}} \right)  \right ] ,\\
& = {\mathbb{E}}\left [  \left( {{{\log }_2}e} \right){e^{\frac{1}{{{\gamma _{i,j,\tau }}}}}}\int_1^\infty  {\frac{1}{u}{e^{ - \frac{u}{{{\gamma _{i,j,\tau }}}}}}du} \right ] ,\\
&  \approx \left( {{{\log }_2}e} \right){e^{\frac{1}{{{\gamma _{i,j,t}}}}}}\int_1^\infty  {\frac{1}{u}{e^{ - \frac{u}{{{\gamma _{i,j,t}}}}}}du} ,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\tau  \in \left[ {\left( {t - 1} \right),t} \right]\Delta \tau$ represents all time $\tau $ within time slot $t$. 
The transmission speed in (2c) is derived based on current study \cite{p41}. We take one step further and complete our long-term large-scale CSI replacement of full CSI in (2d) by assuming that $\beta _{i,j,\tau }$ remains constant (ship $j$ stays in the same position) in each time slot $t$ and taking out the expectation operator. Any further denotation of CSI in this paper refer to the `large-scale CSI' in (2d) for the whole service duration unless specified. The impact of this replacement (assuming that ship $j$ stays in the same position and $\beta _{i,j,\tau }$ remains constant in each time slot $t$) is further discussed in Section IV. 
%With the long-term large-scale channel fading (CSI) known beforehand, we can further design and implement a user scheduling scheme.

\subsection{Objectives \& Problem Formulation}

The total energy consumption of the system consists of a ship-to-shore transmission part and a ship-to-ship transmission part. The service begin time slot and end time slot for user $j$ is denoted by $t_j^{{\rm{B}}},t_j^{{\rm{E}}}$, respectively. Therefore the energy consumption in this system is
\begin{align}
  {{E_{total}} = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^J {{E_j}}  = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^J {\left( {\sum\limits_{t = t_j^{{\rm{B}}}}^{t_j^{{\rm{E}}}} {\sum\limits_{i = 0}^J {{P_{i}}\Delta t_{i,j,t} } } } \right)} },
  \end{align}
where ${P_{i}}$ represents the transmission power of BS/relay $i$, and $\Delta t_{i,j,t}$ represents the transmission duration from transmitter $i$ to receiver $j$ during time slot $t$. %average power consumed by the transmission from BS/relay $i$ to user $j$ during time slot $t$.

Our objective is to minimize the system energy consumption by means of user scheduling in ship-to-shore transmissions and ship-to-ship transmissions. We further denote the link from transmitter $i \in \left\{ {0,1,...,J} \right\}$ (BS/relay, $i = 0$ means BS, $i > 0$ means relay) to receiver $j$ (user) at time slot $t$ by $i \to j@t$. For the link $i \to j@t$, we denote the ratio of used transmission time $\Delta t_{i,j,t}$ to time slot duration $\Delta \tau$ by 
\begin{align}
  {{\eta _{i,j,t}} = \frac{{\Delta {t_{i,j,t}}}}{{\Delta \tau }},{\eta _{i,j,t}} \in \left[ {0,1} \right]}.
\end{align}
$I\left[ {{\eta _{i,j,t}}} \right] = 0$ means there is no transmission from BS/relay $i$ to user $j$ at time slot $t$, while $I\left[ {{\eta _{i,j,t}}} \right] = 1$ means a subcarrier is scheduled at time slot $t$ for the link and the transmission uses ${\eta _{i,j,t}}$ of the transmitter's max transmission power. 

By ${C_{j,t}}$ we denote the total data volume user $j$ currently has at time slot $t$. Since the system has no ship-to-ship link data reuse, user $j$ must have enough data ${C_{j,t}}$ in order to act as relay and transmit to another user $j'$ at $t$

Thus, we formulate the energy consumption optimization problem as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
& \mathop {\min }\limits_{{\mathbf{{\rm H}}} \in {{\left[ {0,1} \right]}^{\left( {J + 1} \right) \times J \times T}}} \left\{ {\sum\limits_{i = 0}^J {\sum\limits_{j = 1}^J {\sum\limits_{t = t_j^{{\rm{B}}}}^{t_j^{{\rm{E}}}} {{P_{i}}\Delta t_{i,j,t} } } } } \right\} ,\\
& {s.t.} \;\; \sum\limits_{i \ne j} {I\left[ {{\eta _{i,j,t}}} \right] }  + \sum\limits_{j' \ne j} { I\left[ {{\eta _{j,j',t}}} \right]  \le {1}} ,\\
& \;\;\;\;\;\; \sum\limits_j {\sum\limits_i { I\left[ {{\eta _{i,j,t}}} \right] } }  \le N ,\\
& \;\;\;\;\;\; {\left. {{{\left. {{C_{j,t}}} \right|}_{t = 0}} = 0, {C_{j,t}}} \right|_{t = T}} \ge C_j^{QoS}, {C_{j,t}} \ge 0, \\
& \;\;\;\;\;\; {C_{j,t}} = \sum\limits_{\tau  = t_j^{{\rm{B}}}}^t {\left( {\sum\limits_i {{r_{i,j,\tau }\Delta t_{i,j,\tau} }}  - \sum\limits_{j'} {{r_{j,j',\tau }\Delta t_{j,j',\tau} }} } \right)} .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
${\mathbf{{\rm H}}}{\text{ = }}{\left\{ {{\eta _{i,j,t}}} \right\}^{\left( {J + 1} \right) \times J \times T}}$ since we have to consider transmissions from ${J + 1}$ transmitters (BS/relays) to $J$ receivers (users) at $T$ time slots. 
%, and our optimization is in a $\left( {J + 1} \right) \times J \times T$ 3-dimensional subspace. 
Half-duplex constraint (5b) guarantees that each user has access to at most one BS/user at a given time, and serves either as a transmitter or as a receiver. The constraint in (5c) guarantees that at most $N$ users can be severed simultaneously in the system, by BS or relays, since there are only $N$ subcarriers. (5d) and (5e) make sure that the QoS constraint is met and relays cannot transmit more than they have currently.

Even if we loosen some restrictions in problem (5) and get a ship-to-shore system, the user scheduling problem later in (7) can still be transformed into a Nonlinear Integer Programming problem, which has been proved to be NP-hard \cite{p420}. Therefore, the original problem in (5) is NP-hard. Given the difficulties in solving the user scheduling problem in (5), we propose the following progressive approach. 
%\textit{Theorem 1:} The problem in (5) is NP-hard.

%\textit{Proof:} See Appendix A. 

\section{User Scheduling for Maritime Ship-to-Ship/Shore Communication}\label{sec:3}

In this section, we focus on the reduction of system energy consumption while ensuring the users' service requirements (QoS). We progressively approach the optimization problem in (5) through 3 efficient algorithms with polynomial time complexity to solve the NP-hard problem.

%\subsection{Problem Formulation}

\subsection{Progressive Approach of the Original-Problem}

The problem (5) is a non-convex optimization problem and is NP-hard. Therefore, conventional methods for solving linear or convex optimization problems are no longer applicable. The original-problem involves various factors, and achieving the optimal solution for the NP-hard problem in (5) is not practical. 

In order to approximate the optimal solution, we first loosen some constraints in (5), and then gradually add them back to approach the original-problem through three progressive algorithms, each based on its predecessor's result. 

First, we focus on long-term user scheduling enabled by large-scale CSI, since the key factor of our long-term scheduling is the utilization of large-scale CSI that we can know in advance. We simply consider the ship-to-shore transmission and ignore the subcarrier constraint and get a greedy result from this simple problem by choosing links with best CSI. 

Second, we use a progressive algorithm based on the result returned by algorithm 1 to make sure that our user scheduling is applicable. Since the ship-to-shore transmissions use no more than $N$ subcarriers, we consider the subcarrier constraint in algorithm 2 and get an approximation of the optimal solution for the ship-to-shore system. 
%The ship-to-shore system in subproblem 1 and 2 remove the transmitter dimension from the optimization subspace since the transmitter only contains BS. Therefore the optimizations in subproblem 1 and 2 are in 2-dimensional subspace.

Last, we consider the maritime ship-to-ship/shore communication system. Benefiting from large-scale CSI between ships, we use another progressive algorithm to substitute part of the ship-to-shore links we get in algorithm 2 for two-hop ship-to-ship/shore links for less energy consumption. Since we only consider two-hop links, each of the substitution ship-to-ship/shore links consists of exact a ship-to-shore part $0 \to i'@{t_1}$ for BS to transmit data to relay ${i'}$ and a ship-to-ship part $i' \to j@{t_2}$ for relay ${i'}$ to transmit to receiver user $j$. The ship-to-ship/shore link $\left[ {{\rm{0}} \to i'@{t_1},i' \to j@{t_2}} \right]$ (one ship-to-shore and one ship-to-ship) in the substitution link set must use less energy combined than the original ship-to-shore link $0 \to j@{t_0}$ for improvement energy-wise. Since the introduction of relays brings forward great difficulties in user scheduling, we use a greedy method in algorithm 3. Like algorithm 1, we greedily choose the ship-to-ship/shore links with best CSI for substitution. 
%The optimization subspace in subproblem 3 remains 3-dimensional.

%Since the key factor of our long-term maritime ship-to-ship/shore user scheduling is the utilization of large-scale CSI that we can know in advance, we first examine the improvement of long-term user scheduling.
%Given the difficulties of multiple transmitters in ship-to-ship/shore system for user-scheduling, we concentrate on the ship-to-shore system in progressive algorithms 1 and 2. 
%Based on the solution returned by algorithm 2, we make adjustments in links (which is still enabled by large-scale CSI between ships) and benefit from ship relays in progressive algorithm 3. 
Eventually, after three algorithms, we approach the optimal solution for the original-problem in (5). In Section IV we prove the validity of our progressive approach by comparing the energy consumptions. 

\subsection{Progressive Algorithm 1}

For the first algorithm, we concentrate on large-scale CSI by considering the most simple scenario: a ship-to-shore only system without subcarrier constraint. We fix transmitter $i = 0$ since users can only receive data from on-shore BS. 

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
& \mathop {\min }\limits_{{\mathbf{{\rm H}}}_{\mathbf{0}} \in {{\left[ {0,1} \right]}^{\left( {J + 1} \right) \times J \times T}}} \left\{ {\sum\limits_{j = 1}^J {\sum\limits_{t = t_j^{{\rm{B}}}}^{t_j^{{\rm{E}}}} {{P_{0}}\Delta t_{0,j,t} } \,} } \right\} ,\\

& \;\;\;\;\;\; {C_{j,t}} = \sum\limits_{\tau  = t_j^{{\rm{B}}}}^t {{r_{0,j,\tau }}\Delta t_{0,j,\tau} }.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
${{\mathbf{{\rm H}}}_{\mathbf{0}}}{\text{ = }}{\left\{ {{\eta _{0,j,t}}} \right\}^{J \times T}}$ since in the first two ship-to-shore progressive algorithms, there is only one transmitter. 
%since the optimization is currently in a $J \times T$ 2-dimensional subspace (the transmitter dimension degenerates since there is only one transmitter, namely BS) 
Half-duplex constraint in (5b) is not necessary here since users can only receive data from BS, and cannot act like relays. We also drop the $N$-subcarrier constraint in (5c) since we assume that the BS can serve infinite number of users. 

In the first algorithm, we optimize ${{\mathbf{{\rm H}}}_{\mathbf{0}}}$ only with constraint (6b) and (6c). In this case, the optimization variables of different users are no longer correlated, and the greedy solution here can be obtained by scheduling each user separately. The problem in (6) can be reduced to $\mathop {\min }\limits_{{{\mathbf{{\rm H}}}_{\mathbf{0}}} \in {{\left[ {0,1} \right]}^T}} \left\{ {\sum\limits_{t = 1}^T {{P_{0}}\Delta t_{0,j,t} } } \right\}$. Note that ${r_{0,j,t}}$ is a monotone increasing function of ${\beta _{0,j,t}}$, therefore we can obtain a easy greedy solution for each user by choosing links with best CSI. 

We further define ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{1}}}$ as the set of chosen ship-to-shore link at a specific time slot in problem (6), i.e., $\left( {0,j,t} \right) \in {\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{1}}$ if ${\eta _{i,j,t}} \in \left( {0,1} \right]$. 

For each user, we find link $0 \to j@t$ with best ${\beta _{0,j,t}}$ and set the ratio of the used transmission power ${\eta _{0,j,t} = 1}$ until the QoS constraint is met.

\subsection{Progressive Algorithm 2}

The solution ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{1}}}$ returned by algorithm 1 is not a practical one for the ship-to-shore system in (6a)-(6c) since (5b) has not been taken into account. We design an effective method to iteratively get the approximate solution ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{2}}}$ which is applicable for the ship-to-shore system. 

As ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{1}}}$ is the greedy solution for (6), we can progressively approximate the optimal solution for the ship-to-shore system by minimizing the energy consumption gap between ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{1}}}$ and the result ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{2}}}$ in progressive algorithm 2. We formulate the problem as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  & \mathop {\min }\limits_{{{\mathbf{{\rm H}}}_{\mathbf{0}}} \in {{\left[ {0,1} \right]}^{J \times T}}} \left\{ {\sum\limits_{j = 1}^J {\sum\limits_{t = {t_j^{{\rm{B}}}}}^{t_j^{{\rm{E}}}} {\left( {\mathop {{P_{0}}\Delta t_{0,j,t'} }\limits_{\left( {0,j,t'} \right) \in {{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{2}}}}  - \mathop {{P_{0}} \Delta t_{0,j,t} }\limits_{\left( {0,j,t} \right) \in {{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{1}}}} } \right)}} } \right\}, \\
  & {s.t.} \;\; \sum\limits_j  { I\left[ {{\eta _{0,j,t}}} \right] }  \le N, \\
& \;\;\;\;\;\; {\left. {{{\left. {{C_{j,t}}} \right|}_{t = 0}} = 0, {C_{j,t}}} \right|_{t = T}} \ge C_j^{QoS},\; {C_{j,t}} \ge 0, \\
& \;\;\;\;\;\; {C_{j,t}} = \sum\limits_{\tau  = {t_j^{{\rm{B}}}}}^t {{r_{0,j,\tau }}\Delta t_{0,j,\tau} }.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Note that we can approximate the optimal solution for the ship-to-shore system by adjusting the user scheduling result in ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{1}}}$. For the following reasons, we minimize the energy consumption gap in objective (7a), aiming to progressively approach the optimal solution based on algorithm 1's result ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{1}}}$. 
If the constraint (7b) isn't met in time slot ${t}$, we have to use alternative links like $\left( {0,j,t'} \right) \in {{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{2}}}$ for replacement. These replacements will satisfy the $N$-subcarrier constraint at the cost of more energy consumption. Hence we minimize the difference term in (7a). % Since ${r_{0,j,t}}$ is a monotone increasing function of ${P_{0,j,t}}$, we have to find substitutions with least system capacity impact, and therefore minimize the energy consumption gap.


To approximate of the optimal solution for problem (7) and store them in ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{2}}}$, we find links in ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{1}}}$ that have the least impact on system capacity if substituted. We drop those links out of ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{2}}}$ and find substitution links to satisfy the QoS need under the $N$-subcarrier constraint in (7b) with minimal energy addition.

\subsection{Progressive Algorithm 3}

After the first two progressive algorithms, we have already claimed an approximation of the optimal solution for the ship-to-shore system. 
% in a $J \times T$ subspace. 
In algorithm 3, we change part of the ship-to-shore links into ship-to-ship/shore links for better energy efficiency. From algorithm 3 we derive the final solution ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{3}}}$, which is a approximation for the optimal final solution due to our progressive approach. ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{3}}}$ contains both ship-to-shore links like $0 \to j@t'$ and ship-to-ship/shore links like $\left[ {{\rm{0}} \to i'@{t_1},i' \to j@{t_2}} \right]$.

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
  & \mathop {\max }\limits_{{\mathbf{{\rm H}}} \in {{\left[ {0,1} \right]}^{\left( {J + 1} \right) \times J \times T}}} \left\{ {{\sum\limits_{j = 1}^J \sum\limits_{t = {t_j^{\rm{B}}}}^{t_j^{\rm{E}}}{\left(  {\mathop {{P_{0}}\Delta t_{0,j,t} }\limits_{\left( {0,j,t} \right) \in {{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{2}}}}  - \sum\limits_{i = 0}^J {\mathop {{P_{i}}\Delta t_{i,j,t}}\limits_{\left( {i,j,t} \right) \in {{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{3}}}} } } \right)} } } \right\}, \\
  & {s.t.} \;\; \sum\limits_{i \ne j} { I\left[ {{\eta _{i,j,t}}} \right] }  + \sum\limits_{j' \ne j} { I\left[ {{\eta _{j,j',t}}} \right]  \le {1}}, \\
  & \;\;\;\;\;\; \sum\limits_j {\sum\limits_i { I\left[ {{\eta _{i,j,t}}} \right] } }  \le N, \\
  & \;\;\;\;\;\; {\left. {{{\left. {{C_{j,t}}} \right|}_{t = 0}} = 0, {C_{j,t}}} \right|_{t = T}} \ge C_j^{QoS} ,\; {C_{j,t}} \ge 0, \\
  & \;\;\;\;\;\; {C_{j,t}} = \sum\limits_{\tau  = t_j^{\rm{B}}}^t {\left( {\sum\limits_i {{r_{i,j,\tau }}\Delta t_{i,j,\tau}}  - \sum\limits_{j'} {{r_{j,j',\tau }}\Delta t_{j,j',\tau}} } \right)} .
  \end{align}
  \end{subequations}

Since the introduction of ship-to-ship links brings forward energy reduction, we can approximate the original-problem in (5a)-(5e) by maximizing the energy consumption reduction between ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{3}}}$ based on algorithm 3 and ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{2}}}$ returned by algorithm 2. The problem here can be expressed as (8a)-(8e), and we maximize the difference term in objective (8a) to approximate the optimal solution. 
  

In (8) ${\mathbf{{\rm H}}}{\text{ = }}{\left\{ {{\eta _{i,j,t}}} \right\}^{\left( {J + 1} \right) \times J \times T}}$ since 
%since the optimization is now in a $\left( {J + 1} \right) \times J \times T$ subspace: 
there are $\left( {J + 1} \right)$ transmitters (BS/relays), $J$ receivers (users) and $T$ time slots. For simplicity, by $0 \to j@{t_0}$ we denote the ship-to-shore link in ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{2}}}$ that is to be replaced by a ship-to-ship/shore link $\left[ {{\rm{0}} \to i'@{t_1},i' \to j@{t_2}} \right]$ in problem (8). Whereas the ship-to-ship/shore substitution link $\left[ {{\rm{0}} \to i'@{t_1},i' \to j@{t_2}} \right]$ in this paper consist of exact a ship-to-shore part $0 \to i'@{t_1}$ and a ship-to-ship part $i' \to j@{t_2}$. 

Since the problem is too difficult and cannot be solved within a short time, we apply the same greedy approach we used in algorithm 1 again in algorithm 3. Since we aim to maximize the ship-to-ship energy reduction for each user (ship), we greedily choose ship-to-ship/shore links with best CSI for substitution. For each user $j$, we first record all plausible ship-to-ship/shore links like $\left[ {{\rm{0}} \to i'@{t_1},i' \to j@{t_2}} \right]$ in a temporary set $\mathbf{R}$. Here `plausible' means that the half-duplex constraint in (8b) and the $N$-subcarrier constraint in (8c) are satisfied and both parts of the links are at speed greater than the that of the original links. Further exploration will be conducted in the plausible ship-to-ship/shore link set $\mathbf{R}$. 

Once we have the plausible set $\mathbf{R}$, we test both ship-to-shore part and ship-to-ship part in each ship-to-ship/shore link to see if they are capable of substitution, i.e., whether there are enough power unused in those link to complete the transmission in the original ship-to-shore link $0 \to j @{t_0}$. Of all the ship-to-ship/shore links that pass the test, we find the combination of ship-to-ship/shore links $\left[ {{\rm{0}} \to i'@{t_1},i' \to j@{t_2}} \right]$ and original link $0 \to j @{t_0}$ that save most power, remove $0 \to j @{t_0}$ from ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{3}}}$ and move $\left[ {{\rm{0}} \to i'@{t_1},i' \to j@{t_2}} \right]$ from $\mathbf{R}$ to ${{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{3}}}$. Continue those steps until the plausible link set $\mathbf{R}$ become empty or there are no power gain from substitution.

\section{Simulation Results}\label{sec:4}

In this section, we provide numerical results for the ship-to-shore method in problem (7) and the proposed ship-to-ship/shore method in problem (8), as well as a reference greedy ship-to-shore method, which based on current CSI only. 
%The reference method optimize the ship-to-shore system based on current CSI, therefore the optimization is in a \textbf{1-dimensional} subspace $J$, rather than the $J \times T$ \textbf{2-dimensional} subspace for the ship-to-shore system in subproblem 1 and 2 or the $\left( {J + 1} \right) \times J \times T$ \textbf{3-dimensional} subspace for IoV underlaid system in subproblem 3. 
For the reference ship-to-shore round-robin method, we have zero information about CSI, thus we find up to $N$ ships in a round-robin method in each time slot. 

\subsection{Parameters \& Denotation}


%We compare the large-scale CSI replacement in (2d) with the complete channel in the following simulations. Moreover, we take one step further by taking the expectation operator out from the original channel in (2a) and replace ${h_{i,j,t}} \sim \mathcal{CN}(0, \mathbf{I})$ with ${\left| {{h_0}} \right|^2} = 1$. Based on a low SNR assumption, we get 

%\begin{align}
%{r_{i,j,t}} \approx {B_s}{\log _2}\left( {1 + \frac{{{P_{i,j,t}}{\beta _{i,j,t}}{{\left| {{h_0}} \right|}^2}}}{{{\sigma ^2}}}} \right).
%\end{align}
%We further discuss the performance of this estimation and the large-scale CSI replacement in (2d) in this section.

As for the simulation parameters, the BS is located in the central position of the plane, while the ships traverse along two intersecting shipping-lanes.
% since we focus on passenger ships scenarios in this study. Moreover, passenger ship assumption suits our study since their shipping-lanes are fixed and their positional information can be easily determined. 
Ships (user) leave the harbors every 15 minutes, and all sail at the speed of 36km/h. The time slot duration here is $\Delta \tau = 60$s. The QoS constraint is 1Gbits/ship if not specified. We assume that the system uses a carrier frequency of 1.9GHz, and has 32 subcarriers, which have identical bandwidth 2MHz. The BS power for ship-to-shore transmission is set to be 10W, whereas the vessels' ship-to-ship/shore transmission power is 1W since they are arguably smaller in size. The antenna height of the BS and the ships is 100m and 10m respectively. The power density of the additive white Gaussian noise is ${-140}$dBm/Hz. 

Of all the following simulations in Figure 2 - 5, the `reference' method refers to the practical situation where we don't have the large-scale CSI for the whole service duration that can be known in advance. Therefore we have to schedule based on current CSI. 

The legend `large-scale CSI' means the algorithms carried out based on large-scale CSI that can be practically obtained through shipping-lanes and timetables. 

The legend `full CSI' actually means the impractical assumption that we can know full CSI for the whole service duration in advance, which is impossible. They are brought into the following simulations just to show the error introduced by assuming the vessels stay in the same place during time slot $t$ in (2d). 


As shown later in Figure 2 - 5, having full CSI indeed will be most feasible. The difference between the large-scale CSI replacement we proposed in (2d) and the impractical long-term `full CSI' that CANNOT be obtained in advance is around 10\%. The error here comes from assuming that ship $j$ stays in the same position and $\beta _{i,j,\tau }$ remains constant during each time slot $t$, as well as not knowing the full CSI. This 10\% error shows that the large-scale CSI replacement in (2d) is quite acceptable. %If we are less strict with the approximation, the ${h_0}$ constant estimation may be acceptable since the estimation in (12) shares similarity in trend and shape with the actual channel. 

One thing that must be stressed on is that although we see more benefit from ship-to-ship relays than the ship-to-shore system, the key factor here is still long-term large-scale CSI. Without it, we can never know when it's best to transmit through relays or BS.

%\Figure[t!](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt){Tranges.png}
%{Average energy consumption per user $E_{avg}$ versus the percentage of pre-acquired CSI.\label{fig4}}

First, we study the impact of only acquiring large-scale CSI for a part of the whole service duration. 

Figure 2 demonstrates the relationship between average energy consumption and the ratio of ${T_{acq}}$ to total service time duration. Here ${T_{acq}}$ represents the time duration whose CSI we can acquire in advance. The QoS constraint here is 1Gbits/user. 
%The larger ${T_{acq}}$ is, the longer can we predict the CSI, and hence the more feasible transmission time slots we can choose from in our method. As a result, we can get more improvement from our process-oriented D2D-aided or ship-to-shore method when ${T_{acq}}$ approximate the total service time duration. 



As we can see, our proposed ship-to-ship/shore method outmatches the ship-to-shore method and the reference method, especially in ideal conditions (which means we can acquire all CSI, ${T_{acq}}=$ total service time). 
The impractical full CSI curves are better than our large-scale CSI replacement generally. 
However, the long-term (larger $T_{acq}$) large-scale CSI result we get is still better than getting full CSI for a shorter period (smaller $T_{acq}$), which justifies our large-scale replacement, since the long-term large-scale CSI can be easily predicted based on shipping lanes and timetables. 

%When the QoS constraint is 1Gbits/user, 
%These improvements prove the superiority in our 3-dimensional optimization over 2-dimensional and 1-dimensional ones. 
%The 40\% percent benefit is steady until the ratio of ${T_{acq}}$ to total service time becomes less than 0.7. 
When ${T_{acq}}$ approximate the total service time duration, we have maximum benefit from the long-term CSI. The large-scale CSI ship-to-ship/shore method consummates 20\% less energy than the ship-to-shore method, 50\% less than the round-robin method since the introduction of ship-to-ship transmission brings forward more transmitters (relays) to choose from. 
Energy consumption rises as the ratio of ${T_{acq}}$ to total service time decreases, mainly because we aim to satisfy as much as possible in fewer time slots. When we can only acquire present CSI, i.e. ${T_{acq}} = 1$, our proposed method retrogresses to the reference method since we no longer any long-term CSI and the proposed methods become greedy with no `future information' about the CSI. Since the ship-to-ship/shore links are even more difficult to find in such short time period, the energy consumption gap between ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship/shore shrinks.

%{Average energy consumption per user $E_{avg}$ versus the QoS constraint ${C_{QoS}}$.\label{fig3}}

Next, we investigate the impact of different service needs in Figure 3 and 4. 

Figure 3 shows the bit-wise average energy consumption under different QoS constraint.
When there is a smaller QoS constraint, which is more often the case in the simulations, our proposed ship-to-ship/shore method outmatches the ship-to-shore method and the reference method. When the QoS constraint is 1Gbits/user, the ship-to-ship/shore method consummates 40\% less energy than the ship-to-shore method, 50\% less than the reference method. The proposed ship-to-ship/shore method's energy consumption approaches proposed the ship-to-shore method as the QoS constraint gets larger. This is because the large QoS demands might take up too many time slots in problem (7), and left the ship-to-ship optimization in problem (8) few time slots with feasible relay links to choose from.

The reference method's bit-wise energy consumption decreases as the QoS constraint get larger, while the proposed methods' energy consumptions increase. The reference method's energy consumption decreases since the reference method is a greedy one, and it aims to meet the QoS constraint as soon as possible. When the QoS constraint is smaller, the reference method may end up choosing many time slots with relatively lower ${\beta _{0,j,t}}$ and can still satisfy the QoS constraint. When the QoS constraint gets larger, the reference method has to choose more time slots, and there are likely to be more time slots with relatively higher ${\beta _{0,j,t}}$ and higher transmission speed ${r_{0,j,t}}$. Under higher overall transmission speed, the reference method's energy consumption per Gbit decreases. The rise in proposed methods' energy consumption is because we end up choosing the time slots with low transmission speed in order to meet the increasing QoS constraint. This results in a larger energy consumption per user per Gbit.

\end{figure}

Figure 4 shows the relationship between average energy consumption and the ratio of delay tolerance to service time duration. In this paper, we assumed delay-tolerant service for maximum benefit from the long-term CSI. Here we further checked the performance of our method under different delay tolerance.

When the delay tolerance ratio $= 1$, the system is fully delay-tolerant, and we once again see the 40\% percent improvement from the introduced transmitters (relays) in optimization. As the delay tolerance gets smaller, the energy consumption of both ship-to-shore method and ship-to-ship/shore method gets larger, and the gap between them shrinks. Similar to what happened in Figure 2, the delay tolerance decrease %the data distribution service has to be done more quickly, and therefore the optimizations' time dimension gets smaller in size. The size drop in time dimension directly result in the energy consumption rise since there are fewer time slots for the links to choose from and the system has to schedule the service in a shorter time period. For the same reason, the ship-to-ship/shore links are even more difficult to find in such short time period since they require two links for one ship-to-ship/shore link. Thus the gap between the ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship/shore optimizations shrinks as the delay tolerance gets smaller.

\caption{Average energy consumption per user $E_{avg}$ per Gbit versus the noise function ${\sigma ^2}$.}\label{fig:5}
\vspace*{-2mm} 
\end{figure}

Last, we investigate the impact of system status, SNR in particular.

Figure 5 shows average energy consumption versus noise ${\sigma ^2}$. As we can see, the energy consumption increases as the noise rises. %The gap between large-scale CSI approximation (2d) and the actual channel remains minimal, whereas the gap between the ${h_0}$ constant estimation and the actual channel shrinks as the noise rises. %The Gaussian noise ${\sigma ^2 ={10^{ - 14}}}$ is more often the case in following simulations. For further tests, we increase the noise ${\sigma ^2}$. 
The worsening in SNR also result in the increase in energy consumption, while making our proposed methods more beneficial as the gap in energy consumption between reference method and proposed ship-to-ship/shore method increases. %The relationship between SNR and the gap are explored below. 

%We estimate ${r_{i,j,t}}$ in (2d) and in (12) both through taking out the expectation operator. Since $x \ge {\log _2}\left( {1 + x} \right)$ when ${x \ge 0}$, the transmission speed or channel capacity ${r_{i,j,t}}$ is smaller in estimation (12) than the actual channel or large-scale CSI replacement in (2d). Therefore, the energy consumptions with the ${h_0}$ constant estimation are smaller than the others, just as showed in Figure 5. 
%Since the ${h_0}$ constant approximation is based on a low SNR assumption, as the noise function ${\sigma ^2}$ increases, the ${h_0}$ constant estimations approximate the large-scale CSI replacement in (2d) and the complete channel energy-wise.

As the SNR decreases, the channel capacity worsens and the greedy reference method end up with more low-speed links. Thus we can see an improvement of over 81\% in energy consumption from the proposed ship-to-ship/shore method when ${\sigma ^2 \le{10^{ - 10}}}$.

In conclusion, the total energy improvement introduced by large-scale CSI and ship-to-ship communication is at least 50\% as shown by simulations in Figure 2 - 5. The approximate optimal solution we deduced from Algorithm 1 - 3 with polynomial time complexity show its potential as well as its simplicity. Therefore, the progressive approach through 3 algorithms in Section III is justified. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:5}

In this paper, we focused on the reduction of energy consumption through user scheduling in maritime ship-to-ship/shore communication system. 
We reduce the energy consumption by using large-scale CSI for the whole service duration and implementing ship-to-ship transmission. 
%, which introduce the time dimension and transmitter (BS/relay) dimension in our optimization subspace respectively. Together with the receiver (user) dimension which has been studied previously, our optimization subspace becomes 3-dimensional and therefore provides great potential. 
By utilizing each users' positional information acquired from their specific shipping-lanes, we replace the complete channel with large-scale CSI during the whole service process. Further, we progressively approach the NP-hard energy consumption optimization problem through 3 algorithms. By solving the first we approach the optimal solution for the ship-to-shore system in algorithm 1 and 2. % in a 2-dimensional optimization subspace (one receiver dimension and one time dimension). 
Proceeding to the 3rd algorithm, we further benefit from more transmitters (relays) with ship-to-ship transmission and achieved an improvement up to 81\% in certain cases. % from optimization subspace with a higher dimension. 
The iterative algorithms we proposed can return progressive approximation of the optimal solution with polynomial time complexity. Simulation results justify our large-scale CSI replacement and show that the schemes significantly enhances the system performance in terms of energy consumption.
